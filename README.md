# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe android app is a good project for beginners, this is a two player game, 
where each player will get a chance one after the other. This game will be having a grid of 3 X 3 with a total of 9 cells.
The players are supposed to fill each cell alternatively. The Player one would need to fill the cell with ‘X’and the player will use ‘O’ to fill the cells. 
Our application will have the following things in its interface:

1.It will have a grid with 9 boxes or cells.
2.It will display who’s turn it is
3.Then it’ll have the Restart button. This button can help the player to restart the game at any time they like.
4.Once the game is over the app will declare who lost the game. If no one wins, it will declare that it was a draw match.
